# U-Transformer for Underwater Image Restoration
This repository contains the implementation of a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based U-Transformer architecture for restoring degraded and biofouled underwater images. The model combines the global contextual power of ViT with a CNN-based decoder for high-fidelity image reconstruction.
